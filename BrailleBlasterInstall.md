# Introduction #

Currently there is only a functioning installer for Windows, for other platforms see BuildingFromSource.


# Installing on Windows #

To run BrailleBlaster you will need a Java runtime environment, this can be downloaded from the [Oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/). Once you have installed Java you may then proceed with installing BrailleBlaster.

You can find the installer for Windows at [BrailleBlaster download page](http://www.brailleblaster.org/dist/). When you run the installer it should detect the installed Java runtime and whether your system requires 32-bit or 64-bit native libraries.
