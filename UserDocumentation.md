The BrailleBlaster application is intended to let loose a blast of braille, like a blast of fresh air for people suffocating for lack of good technical material in braille. That has been my experience since childhood.<br>

# Introduction and Overview #

BraileBlaster is a free and open-source, multi-platform, XML-centric braille production system that is powerful enough to be used in the most demanding braille production environments and yet simple enough for anyone to create braille documents quickly and easily. BrailleBlaster makes full use of rich markup in source material and allows for added enhancements that serve to create accurate and high-quality braille, while preserving all the richness of the original semantic markup.

BrailleBlaster is a joint project of The American Printing House for the Blind, Inc. http://www.aph.org,
View Plus Technologies, Inc. http://www.viewplus.com,
and Abilitiessoft http://www.abilitiessoft.com

Braille Blaster features include:

  * Simple, yet powerful, user interface
  * Dynamic editing environment, providing both text and braille views
  * Runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems
  * Fully accessible to users of screen readers
  * Optimized for users with low vision
  * Supports multiple languages
  * Creates anything from simple braille documents to complex braille textbooks and technical material
  * Natively uses various XML document types such as EPUB, NIMAS, and DAISY
  * Supports accessibility features such as image descriptions and tactile graphics
  * Supports translation of MathML to Nemeth, UK Math, and Marburg math

## XML-centric Design ##

XML has become the standard way of representing documents containing content with rich semantic markup. It is used in such document types as:

  * DAISY
  * NIMAS
  * Microsoft Word
  * EPUB 3
  * Open Document Format (Used in Open Office and LibreOffice)

Such rich semantic markup provides information that can help automate the production of Braille. Such elements as headings, lists, tables, citations, blockquotes, and many more are clearly identified.

Currently most braille production processes are complicated and result in a braille ready file (BRF) that has no connection to the source document from which it was produced. With BrailleBlaster, we are introducing a new approach that makes full use of rich markup. It allows for enhancements that serve to create accurate and high-quality braille, while preserving all the richness of the original semantic markup. It also allows the document, once made ready for Braille, to be instantly rendered in a variety of ways.

## Automated Braille Production ##

In theory rich markup should make it possible to produce high-quality braille with no human intervention. In practice things get more complicated.

  * Semantic markup is at times not used or misused.
  * Images are used in place of real data as in charts, tables, and mathematics.
  * Images may convey important information.
  * Publication and accessibility guidelines are not well known or are simply not followed.
  * At times braille requires a creative approach to provide the best tactile experience for a learner.

In comparison, automated Braille production often results in Braille that is not of excellent quality, especially when dealing with complex textbooks and other learning material. The human approach generally results in excellent results but at a high cost. BrailleBlaster is designed to provide the best of both automated production and the extra level of excellence offered by a human transcriber.

## Flexible Use ##

In addition to the need for a human touch in creating excellent braille educational material, the fact remains that a BRF may not ultimately be the desired product. While there needs to be a convenient path to producing hard-copy embossed braille, more and more of these documents are consumed on electronic devices. BrailleBlaster makes this possible by allowing enhanced Braille and tactile elements to be kkept as a part of the original rich document and thus to be instantly rendered on a variety of devices.

## More Than a Braille Word Processor ##

BrailleBlaster uses the concept of "perspectives" to allow it to be used as a tool for adding image descriptions and making general improvements to the XML markup of NIMAS and EPUB3 documents. If the only interest is in describing images, the image describer perspective can be used and the Braille aspects of BrailleBlaster can be ignored. Future plans include additional perspectives, such as a tactile graphics editor perspective, editing of MathML, and others.
